# RLC Circuits

An RLC series circuit is the basic building block of radio transmission lines. It can be used as a radio tuner, a bandpass filter, a bandstop filter, a pulse discharge circuit, an oscillatory circuit and as a voltage multiplier. Here, we are trying to use an RLC circuit as a radio tuner to select a particular frequency corresponding to certain radio stations in the Boston area. After that, we plan to model the non-ideal, temperature dependent behaviour of the inductors and the capacitors used in our circuit.
