# RLC Circuits

Modeling and Simulation in Python (Olin College Fall 2017) project 3 code and documentation.

# Summary

An RLC series circuit is the basic building block of radio transmission lines. It can be used as a radio tuner, a bandpass filter, a bandstop filter, a pulse discharge circuit, an oscillatory circuit and as a voltage multiplier. Here, we are modeling an RLC circuit as a radio using Python. The circuit will be used to tune it to a particular frequency corresponding to certain radio stations in the Boston area.
